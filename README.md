# Miserable Clyde's Adventures in Customer Service
MCAICS (Email Game) is a game about answering really boring emails aboard a haunted space station. That might sound exciting but remember, in a world with ghosts and ghost hunters, someone has to sort through every report from a dozen people who think ghosts are the reason their monitor doesn't work, or they heard a weird bump in the night. The player is asked to type out dozens of politely worded emails each day, while their spine slowly diminishes. Adjust your seating position by pressing 'F1' and enter Spine O Vision, a mode that allows you to see the effects your current sitting position is having on your spine. You can then change it depending on your needs.

# The Contractor.
A narrative game about murdering someone for cash money. It attempts a tone of dark humour. Be warned that the game does involve shooting someone in the face. Montage is used to convey a sense of travel.
