# Miserable Clyde's Adventures in Customer Service
MCAICS (Email Game) is a game about answering really boring emails aboard a haunted space station. That might sound exciting but remember, in a world with ghosts and ghost hunters, someone has to sort through every report from a dozen people who think ghosts are the reason their monitor doesn't work, or they heard a weird bump in the night. The player is asked to type out dozens of politely worded emails each day, while their spine slowly diminishes. Adjust your seating position by pressing 'F1' and enter Spine O Vision, a mode that allows you to see the effects your current sitting position is having on your spine. You can then change it depending on your needs.

## Controls
WASD to move. Left mouse to interact with the chair/computer. Once sitting down, move the mouse over the UI and press buttons. Check your inbox, some emails can be replied to. When replying to an email, simply type out the greyed out words and they will fill in one character at a time. Hit send when every character is typed out to score a single point for that day.
## Spine Mechanics
F1 to enter Spine Mode while sitting. Change sitting position by clicking arrows. A good Drain Modifier means the bar will drain slower over time. A good Stamina Regen means you will gain back a large chunk of health when confirming the combo. After choosing a combo, you cannot change sitting positiong for 5 seconds, so choose wisely. Running out of spinal health enters Scoliosis Mode. This lasts 20 seconds and reverses all the controls.

# The Contractor.
A narrative game about murdering someone for cash money. It attempts a tone of dark humour. Be warned that the game does involve shooting someone in the face. Montage is used to convey a sense of travel.

## Controls

WASD to move. Left mouse to interact with items (icon will appear to indicate what can be interacted with). Do what the notes tell you. When you have the gun, you only have three shots. Make them count.
