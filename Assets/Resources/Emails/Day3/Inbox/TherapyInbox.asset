    <i>Hello there, CLYDE THUNDERPANTS, I understand that you are having problems
    with: Mental Health. What is the reason for your call today? </i>\n\n<b>Patient:
    CLYDE THUNDERPANTS:</b> <i>I think there\u2019s something wrong with me. I feel
    really dissatisfied with my life and I don\u2019t even understand why. Is this
    normal? Is what I\u2019m feeling normal to feel?</i>\n\n<b>DB:</b> <i>Oh dear,
    CLYDE THUNDERPANTS, that sounds terrible. I am not a licensed medical professional.
    It sounds like you are feeling: SAD. </i>\n\n<b>Patient:</b> <i>No, not sad.
    I don\u2019t think I feel sad. I feel\u2026 stuck? Like my life isn\u2019t really
    going anywhere. I\u2019m not really good at anything and my job is answering
    emails all day. I don\u2019t really have any hobbies or goals for myself. I feel
    exhausted; like a used match. Like I\u2019m already dead.</i>\n\n<b>DB:</b> <i>How
    SAD would you say you feel, on a scale of one to three?</i>\n\n<b>Patient:</b>
    <i>NO- no. I said I\u2019m not sad. I just feel like my life is over. I don\u2019t
    get why. I\u2019m so tired of feeling this way. Why can\u2019t I just be satisfied?
    Why can\u2019t I just be normal?</i>\n\n<b>DB:</b> <i>I understand. You\u2019re
    not feeling SAD. I am not a licensed medical professional. It sounds like you\u2019re
    feeling: NOT HAPPY.</i>\n\n<b>Patient:</b> <i>What a joke. What a terrible idea
    this was. What\u2019s the point in talking to a robot with three responses to
    anything I actually say?</i>\n\n<b>DB:</b> <i>It sounds like you\u2019d like
    to access our Premium Service: Glinbo Mental Health Plus. If you enter your credit
    information, I can transfer your call to one of our many trained mental health
    professionals: all of which are 100% guaranteed to be a real, authentic human.</i>\n\n<b>DB:</b>
