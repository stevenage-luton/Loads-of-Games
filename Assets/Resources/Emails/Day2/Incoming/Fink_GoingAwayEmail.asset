  EmailBody: 'Hey,


    Heading down the vine for a few days. I''ll be staying in
    my mid-vine apartment, so I won''t be too far if you need me.


    Cain, you''re
    in charge of IT until I get back. Clyde, I apologize in advance for all the emails
    you''re going to get because of this.


    Good luck all,


    Fink
