  Subject: 'FWD: Fukt Tracking Info'
  EmailBody: 'Hello Mr. Thunderpants,


    I wanted to update you on a situation
    regarding the tracking information for a package we''re due to ship out for Fukt
    Microelectronics for the next TLI launch window. They''d entered some info wrong
    on the declaration form and got a bit lost in the system, so they''ve probably
    not received any tracking information. We''ve had to try and work it all out
    by hand.


    If they complain, tell them the tracking number is FK2160004-LT.
    We''ve slapped a tracker on it and it''s going out next month.


    Regards,


    Sandra
    Bacon
