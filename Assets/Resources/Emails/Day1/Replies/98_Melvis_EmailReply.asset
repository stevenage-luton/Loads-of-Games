  EmailBody: 'Greetings all,


    Remember the issue we previously discussed at
    length about the fire elemental in the bunsen burner in lab 5? Jaft, I believe
    you were concnerned about it also possibly being "Death Fire"?


    Well as
    it turns out, it was just regular fire. False alarm.


    Warmest possible regards,


    Clyde'
