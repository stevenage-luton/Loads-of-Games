  Subject: New policy regarding complaints
  EmailBody: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nWe've had a lot of complaints recently regarding
    our responses to potentially magic-related incidents occurring across the station.
    As you may be aware, there have been a lot of false-positives lately and this
    has naturally led to what the public sees as unjust or overviolent responses
    on our part. \nI\u2019m sure everyone is aware of the potential Cerberus/Dire
    Hound reported in Maintenance that unfortunately led to Atmospheric Technician
    Basinger\u2019s pet dog Snuffles being Bonecrunched in an officer-involved piledriving.\r\n\r\nAs
    a result, we\u2019ve spoken to station management, and it\u2019s been decided
    that we\u2019re closing our complaints department. All complaints are to be handled
    by station administration, who will act as a liaison between us and the general
    public.\r\n\r\n<b> Meridian Station Curse Management | Combat Exorcist Dispatch
    </b>\r\n\r\n<i> do not reply to this email. This address is not monitored. </i>"
