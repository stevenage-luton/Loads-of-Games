  EmailBody: 'Hey Clyde,


    Remember that email the other day from the lab tech
    who was worried about the fire elemental in the bunsen burner? I''ve just got
    word from Jen that it''s actually just regular fire. Tell Morris to stop complaining
    that we never do anything for his department.


    And don''t forget to CC in
    the Curse Squad this time!
