  Subject: 'RE:RE: The Labs'
  EmailBody: "Greetings Mr. Thunderpants,\r\n\r\nThank you for investigating this
    issue. Your response time was adequately brisk. We were able to open the affected
    lab without much downtime.\r\n\r\nI take issue with the insinuation that I was
    the one who raised the idea of \u201CDeath Fire\u201D as a possible cause for
    the issue with the Bunsen burner. I think tensions in the room were very high
    at the time, I was simply agreeing that it might be a <i>possibility</i> when
    the theory was raised by one of my assistants (I can\u2019t remember who exactly).\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    thank you for getting to the bottom of this before Clark and his Curse Squad
    goons came down to smash everything with hammers. This time at least. \r\n\r\nColdest
    Regards,\r\n\r\nJaft Morris,\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSenior
    Research Technologist, Meridian Station\r"
