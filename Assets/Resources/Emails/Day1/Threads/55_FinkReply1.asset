  EmailBody: "Awesome, we're back up. Shouldn't be any more issues with the servers
    now the migration is finished. \n\nI have no idea why management gave us such
    a small window, haven't crunched this hard since the stationwide OS upgrade for
    that centennial zero-day. I guess that was before you joined, but still.\n\nCheers,\n\nFink\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLead
