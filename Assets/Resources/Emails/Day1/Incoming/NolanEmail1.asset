  Subject: Possible ghost????
  EmailBody: "Hey Clyde,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say that I'm reasonably sure that
    there\u2019s a spectre of some kind haunting the maintenance passage near waste
    management. I was checking the wiring there earlier today and I heard a big clanging
    sound, like metal scraping against metal. Pretty spooky.\r\n\r\nI ran away as
    fast as I could. I\u2019d call the Curse Management Team but Snuffles is in a
    full body cast because of those bastards, so I\u2019d rather check with you to
    see what the procedure is. Do you reckon this is worth investigating?\n\n<i>Nolan
    Basinger, Atmospheric Technician, Meridian Station</i>\r"
