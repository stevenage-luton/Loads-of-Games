  Subject: Fink is late?
  EmailBody: "Hey Clyde,\r\n\r\nI remember Fink saying he had some business down
    the vine and he'd be off-station for a couple of days. Well, it's been a couple
    of days. \r\n\r\nHe's nearly two hours late for work, which is whatever, but
    there hasn\u2019t been any malfunction reported with the lifts in months. Did
    he just oversleep? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even seen him take a sick day
    before.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to check in, thought you\u2019d probably know more
    about it than me. You\u2019re probably more in the loop for anything involving
    management anyway, right?\r\n\r\nTalk later,\r\n\r\nCain\r\n\r\n<i>Cain Glover
    : Senior Server Specialist </i>\r"
