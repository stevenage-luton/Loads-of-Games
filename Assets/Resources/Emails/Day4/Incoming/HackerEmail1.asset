  Subject: 'URGENT: CYBER ATTACK'
  EmailBody: "Greetings,\n\nIt has come to our attention that yesterday afternoon,
    malicious actors were able to gain access to one of our databases and made off
    with hundreds of confidential documents belonging to our company.\n\nOur security
    team has just now finished our Incident Response Assessment, and it was discovered
    that a piece of Intrusion Detection Software managed to trace the connection
    that one of the attackers was using. It came from inside the Meridian Station
    network. Not the one open to the public, the admin/systems internal network.\n\nEither
    the attacker is someone employed by your IT Department, or your network security
    is so lax that attackers were able to gain access to it without anyone noticing
    or informing us. Neither are acceptable.\n\nWe have 48 hours until we\u2019re
    required to inform the public about this attack. I suggest you get to the bottom
    of this before then."
